This report presents a series of experiments about matrix transposition conducted %
with OpenMPI, a Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. The primary objectives %
of these experiments were to assess the scalability, speedup, and efficiency of %
parallelized algorithms using OpenMPI on a distributed computing environment like %
the University's HPC cluster. The experiments encompassed various serial and parallel %
algorithms and configurations, shedding light on the impact of factors such as %
communication overhead and workload distribution.\\
The results of these experiments were then analyzed and compared to the theoretical %
expectations, providing insight into the performance of parallel applications %
and the factors that affect them.
